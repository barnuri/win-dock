# Win Dock

A feature-rich macOS SwiftUI application that emulates the Wi## Requirements

-   macOS 14 Sonoma or later
-   Xcode 15 or newer (Swift 5.9)

## Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barnuri/win-dock.git
cd win-dock
open WinDock.xcodeproj
```

## Build & Run from Terminal

## Releases and Versioning

This project uses automated GitHub Actions for building and releasing. The workflow automatically:

1. **Bumps version** in `Info.plist` (patch, minor, or major)
2. **Builds the app** using Xcode
3. **Creates a git tag** with the new version
4. **Creates a GitHub release** with the built app as a downloadable asset

### Triggering a Release

-   **Automatic**: Push to `master` branch triggers a patch version bump and release
-   **Manual**: Use GitHub Actions workflow dispatch to choose version bump type (patch/minor/major)

### Local Version Management

You can also bump versions locally using the included script:

```bash
# Bump patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
./bump_version.sh patch

# Bump minor version (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
./bump_version.sh minor

# Bump major version (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
./bump_version.sh major
```

## What's New

This is a major improvement over the initial MVP version with the following enhancements:

### Architecture Improvements

-   **Proper Background App**: Runs as an accessory app (no dock icon) with LSUIElement
-   **Clean Window Management**: Custom DockWindow class with proper window level and positioning
-   **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into DockWindow, AppManager, DockContentView, and SettingsView

### Enhanced Features

-   **Smart App Detection**: Dynamic monitoring of app launches/quits with real-time updates
-   **Pinned Applications**: Persistent pinned apps with default favorites (Finder, Safari, Mail, etc.)
-   **Rich Context Menus**: Right-click menus with Show/Hide/Quit/Pin/Unpin options
-   **App Previews**: Hover previews showing app name and window count
-   **Visual Indicators**: Running dots and window count badges
-   **Settings Panel**: Configurable options for dock behavior and appearance

### User Experience

-   **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions for better visual feedback
-   **Better Positioning**: Proper screen edge positioning that respects safe areas
-   **Multi-monitor Ready**: Foundation for multi-display support
-   **All Spaces Support**: Works across all macOS Spaces

### Technical Improvements

-   **Modern APIs**: Uses latest macOS APIs and avoids deprecated methods
-   **Proper Entitlements**: Configured for dock-like behavior without sandbox restrictions
-   **Error Handling**: Better error handling and edge case management
-   **Performance**: Efficient app monitoring with minimal system impact

This version is now much closer to uBar functionality and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements!askbar, similar to uBar.
